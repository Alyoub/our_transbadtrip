## 3. Using WebSockets for Real-time Communication

Learn to set up WebSocket connections in frontend applications:

- [WebSocket MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)
- [Socket.IO Documentation](https://socket.io/docs/)

### Key Topics:

- Setting up WebSocket connection using `new WebSocket()`
- Sending and receiving messages with WebSocket
- Handling WebSocket events (open, message, error, close)
- Integrating WebSockets with chat or game state in real-time

---

## 4. Building a Multiplayer Game (Frontend)

Learn how to build the frontend for a real-time multiplayer game:

- [Building Multiplayer Games with WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
- [Game Development with JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript)

### Key Topics:

- Handling game state on the frontend (Player positions, scores)
- Sending and receiving game moves over WebSockets
- Rendering real-time game state updates in the UI (Canvas, HTML5 Game Engines)

---

## 5. Building a Chat Application (Frontend)

Learn how to build the frontend for a real-time chat application:

- [Building a WebSocket Chat with JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_a_websocket_server)
- [Simple WebSocket Chat Example](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/websockets/websockets_simple_chat.htm)

### Key Topics:
